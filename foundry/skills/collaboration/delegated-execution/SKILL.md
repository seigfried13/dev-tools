# Delegated Execution Skill

## Overview

This skill orchestrates the execution of a detailed implementation plan by delegating individual tasks to a chosen AI agent (Gemini, Jules, or Claude). It integrates with the `delegation` skill for task assignment and the `requesting-code-review` skill for quality assurance, providing a robust framework for automated development.

## Core Concepts

### Plan-Driven Execution

This skill consumes an implementation plan (typically generated by the `writing-plans` skill) and executes it task by task. Each task is delegated to an AI agent, and its completion is monitored.

### Iterative Review

After each task (or a batch of tasks), a code review is initiated to ensure quality and catch issues early. Feedback from the review can be used to guide subsequent tasks or trigger fixes.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you have a detailed implementation plan (e.g., from the `writing-plans` skill) and you want to leverage an external AI agent (Gemini, Jules, or Claude) to execute the plan. This is particularly useful for parallelizing work or offloading tasks that are well-defined and can be executed autonomously.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the delegated-execution skill to implement this plan using an external agent."

## Commands

### `/execute:delegated-plan`

Starts the delegated execution of an implementation plan.

**Parameters:**

*   `plan_file` (required): The path to the implementation plan file.
*   `agent` (required): The name of the agent to delegate tasks to (e.g., `gemini`, `jules`, `claude`).

## Examples

### Executing a plan with Gemini

```
/execute:delegated-plan plan_file="docs/plans/2025-11-04-new-feature.md" agent="gemini"
```

### Executing a plan with Jules

```
/execute:delegated-plan plan_file="docs/plans/2025-11-05-bug-fix.md" agent="jules"
```

## Workflow

1.  **Load Plan:** The implementation plan is loaded from the specified `plan_file`.
2.  **Iterate Tasks:** The skill iterates through each task defined in the plan.
3.  **Delegate Task:** For each task:
    *   The `delegation` skill is called with the task description, estimated complexity, and the chosen `agent`.
    *   The skill waits for the delegated task to be completed by the agent.
4.  **Code Review:** After each task (or a configurable batch of tasks), the `requesting-code-review` skill is invoked to review the changes made by the agent.
5.  **Apply Feedback:** If the code review identifies issues, the skill can delegate follow-up tasks to the agent to address the feedback.
6.  **Complete Development:** Once all tasks are completed and reviewed, the `finishing-a-development-branch` skill is invoked to finalize the work (e.g., merge, create PR).

## Common Pitfalls

*   **Incomplete Plans:** If the `plan_file` is incomplete or lacks sufficient detail, the delegated agent may struggle to execute the tasks effectively.
*   **Unclear Task Complexity:** Incorrectly estimating task complexity in the plan can lead to suboptimal model selection and execution.
*   **Ignoring Code Review Feedback:** Failing to address feedback from the `requesting-code-review` skill can lead to quality issues in the final implementation.

## Best Practices

*   **Detailed Plans:** Ensure your implementation plans are as detailed and unambiguous as possible.
*   **Accurate Complexity:** Carefully estimate the complexity of each task to ensure the right model is used.
*   **Act on Feedback:** Promptly address any issues raised during the code review process.

## Integration

**Called by:**

*   `writing-plans`: After an implementation plan has been created.

**Uses:**

*   `delegation`: For delegating individual tasks to AI agents.
*   `requesting-code-review`: For initiating code reviews.
*   `finishing-a-development-branch`: For completing the development work.
